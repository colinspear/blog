Howdy -- thanks for checking out my website! 

I've done a lot of things over the years, but have been gradually moving closer and closer to [_the data_.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xALBIKkq1G0)
I have slowly and painfully come to realize that this is an ever-deepening spiral that is best enjoyed with documentation.

Hence this website.
I plan to primarily focus on the technical aspects of [_the data_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xALBIKkq1G0) here, but I will almost certainly use it to think and speculate about related topics as well. So buckle up, cowpoke.

My formal training is in sculpture, spanish, math and economics; I've worked as a tennis coach, baker, researcher and consultant; and I like to pick at my guitar, breathe fresh air and consume delicious food. 
I've spent the last five years developing analytical, technical and business skills and am finally getting around to making a website to document my work.

I'm currently employed at the [Deetken Group](http://www.deetken.com/), a public sector consulting firm that works on a broad variety of projects. 
Our roots are in economic and financial consulting, but we've also been hard at work building out our end to end data science capabilities.
