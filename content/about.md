Hello!

I am Colin Spear, a baker turned economist turned all around data geek. I've had an affinity for numbers and math as long as I can remember and am a methodological libertine, having cut my teeth in the causal inference and prediction of econometrics and constrained optimization of economic theory, later deepening those statistical underpinnings through PhD coursework and in recent years devleoping an interest in machine learning and software development. I have been lucky enough in my professional life to apply much of what I learned in school to the professional world and continue to learn and explore exciting new developments in the world of applied statistics, machine learning and software engineering.


In addition to the above, I'm a dad, a husband, a music lover, amateur outdoorsman, traveler and overall a bit of a dilettante. What can I say, the world is an incredibly interesting place[^1]! This is a space for me to document learnings big and small, explore ideas and show off projects. It is still pretty young so bear with me as it grows up.

Thanks for visiting and please be in touch if you see anything that piques your interest, curiosity or ire.

[^1]: Conveniently this aligns with my belief that we learn better, are more effective and creative and are generally better people if our interests are broad and our minds are open.
